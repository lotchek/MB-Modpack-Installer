>### The Game isn't starting?

  ***Fabric is probably still processing the mods!***  
  To check if your game is actually doing something, open your **Task Manager** and look for a `Java` or `Minecraft` process.  
  You can slightly speed up the first launch by starting the Fabric client once **without** the modpack installed.

---
>### Mods not loading?

  *Make sure you **run Minecraft** with the **Fabric 1.10 client**!*

---

>### My Windows said this installer is not safe!!!

This warning appears because the installer isn't digitally signed. I don't own a Microsoft Developer certificate. If Windows Defender SmartScreen shows a red warning and you feel uncomfortable, you can safely skip the installer and manually download the packs using the links above.

## Modlist

The server is configured with these mods in mind. Optional mods are client-sided and not required to play on the server.

*Nearly all mods can be directly configured in-game using the Mod Menu.*
